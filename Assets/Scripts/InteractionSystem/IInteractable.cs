*    Description: Interface that all interactable objects will derive from. 
*       Includes a function to Interact, and to turn on and off the UI prompt.
*       The player parameter is included on Interact() so that each interactable
        object has a reference to the player built into the function, and we
        shouldn’t have to find the player.
